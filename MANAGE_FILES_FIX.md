# 🔧 Manage Files Page - Error Fixed!

## ❌ Error Encountered

```
page.js:88  Uncaught TypeError: submissions.map is not a function
    at ManagePage (page.js:88:27)
```

### What Happened:
The **Manage Files** page (`/manage`) was crashing because the API response format didn't match what the frontend expected.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Backend Returns:
```json
{
  "submissions": [...],
  "count": 3
}
```

### Frontend Expected:
```javascript
// Direct array
[...]
```

### The Problem:
The `getSubmissions()` function in `api.js` was returning the whole response object, but the page was trying to call `.map()` on it directly, which failed because it's not an array.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Fixed: `src/lib/api.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
export async function getSubmissions() {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/submissions`)
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch submissions')
  }
  return res.json()  // ❌ Returns whole object
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
export async function getSubmissions() {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/submissions`)
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch submissions')
  }
  const data = await res.json()
  // Backend returns {submissions: [...], count: ...}
  // We only need the submissions array
  return data.submissions || []  // ✅ Returns just the array
}
```

---

## 🎯 What Was Changed

1. **Extracted submissions array** from the response object
2. **Added fallback** to empty array `|| []` to prevent errors if submissions is undefined
3. **Added comment** explaining the backend response format

## 🔄 Servers Running

Make sure both servers are active:

### Backend (FastAPI):
```bash
cd "C:\Users\kanna\OneDrive\Desktop\Plagiarism Flask\backend"
python app.py
```
**Status**: ✅ Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Frontend (Next.js):
```bash
cd "C:\Users\kanna\OneDrive\Desktop\Plagiarism Flask\frontend-nextjs"
npm run dev
```
**Status**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3000

## 🐛 Other Potential Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Empty Submissions
**Symptom**: "No submissions found" message
**Cause**: No files uploaded yet
**Solution**: Upload a test file first from home page

### Issue 2: Backend Not Running
**Symptom**: "Failed to fetch submissions" error
**Cause**: Backend server stopped
**Solution**: Restart backend with `python app.py`

### Issue 3: CORS Error
**Symptom**: Browser console shows CORS error
**Cause**: Backend CORS not configured
**Solution**: Already handled - backend has CORS enabled for all origins

## 💡 Why This Error Happened

### Common React/Next.js Pattern:
When fetching data from APIs, always ensure you return the correct data structure. The page component expected an array to use `.map()`, but received an object.

### Prevention Tips:
1. **Always check API response format** in backend code
2. **Extract the needed data** in the API helper function
3. **Add fallbacks** for undefined/null cases
4. **Test with console.log** to see actual data structure

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### What to Say:
> "I built a complete file management system where users can view all uploaded submissions, see storage statistics, and delete files. I encountered a data structure mismatch between the backend API and frontend expectations, which I debugged and fixed by ensuring the API helper function extracts the correct array format from the response."

### Demonstrates:
✅ Full-stack debugging skills
✅ Understanding of API contracts
✅ Problem-solving ability
✅ Error handling with fallbacks
✅ User-friendly interface design
